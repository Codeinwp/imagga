Imagga Auto Tagging is a tool that an API to generate tags to posts based on the thumbnail image.

== Description ==

Let's say you have a photograpy blog. Here comes the big hassle...
These images come without any structured meta-data, so you can't really take advantage of them. All you can do is manually add tags to each post using expensive human labor and effort.
Using Imagga Auto Tagging, you can assign relevant tags to all these posts in an automated fashion! Your post thumbnail is parsed through our Auto-Tagging API, we analyze it and add the tags that should be associated with. 

== Installation ==

1. In your WordPress admin, go to **Plugins > Add New**

4. Once the process is complete, click the **Activate Plugin** link
