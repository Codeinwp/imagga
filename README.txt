Imagga Auto Tagging is a plugin that automatically adds tags to your posts based on their featured images.

== Description ==

The plugin checks the images you upload and adds relevant tags to the posts, so you won't have to add them manually. Each featured image is analyzed and receives tags that can be associated with it.
The tags are generated through our Auto-Tagging API and all you have to do is to sign up to Imagga.com and enter the provided key in your dashboard. 

== Installation ==

Activating Imagga Auto Tagging plugin is just like any other plugin. If you've uploaded the plugin package to your server already, skip to step 5 below:

1. In your WordPress admin, go to **Plugins > Add New**
2. In the Search field type "imagga auto tagging"
3. Under "Imagga Auto Tagging," click the **Install Now** link
4. Once the process is complete, click the **Activate Plugin** link
5. Now, you're able to add contact forms but, first, we could configure a few settings. These can be found at **Settings -> Imagga**
6. Add your authorization key.
7. Click Submit.

All done. All you have to do now is adding a post thumbnail and publish that post. Tags will be added automatically
